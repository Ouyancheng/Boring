# Boring
Code written while I am boring... 

### HelloAppcode (Feb. 10, 2018) -- A boring way to call a function...
I'm happy to install AppCode for writing C++...

And I begin with implementing a super boring way to call a function...

Here's a cheap copy of std::function, a function caller and a member function binder...

GCC complains this piece of code... Is it a bug on GCC???

### FakeAny (Feb. 11, 2018) -- A simple implementation of any...
A trivial type erasure technique... A cheap copy of boost::any...

### IsItQuickSort (Feb. 12, 2018) -- Two sortings, and they look very similar...
One is and one is not...
Can you tell which is which?
